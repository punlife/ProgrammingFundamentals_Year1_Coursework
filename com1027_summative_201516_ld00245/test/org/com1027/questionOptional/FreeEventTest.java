/**
 * Tests for the FreeEvent class.
 * 
 * Please note that this is not the most efficient way to create the FreeEvent objects. In the optional extra question of the
 * coursework by using a static method in the constructor you can get rid of the overhead of constructing a map of prices which are
 * all zero. There is a way of being able to do that in the FreeEvent class. But since we haven't explicitly covered it during the
 * lectures I haven't included it in the tests for question 3 and therefore the tests look a little verbose for FreeEvent objects
 * because the code itself should be able to know that there is no prices attached to free tickets. However, it is not a problem to
 * define them explicitly beforehand and pass them in as values to the constructor. In question 3, I am expecting them to be defined
 * beforehand and passed in when a FreeEvent object is created.
